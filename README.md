# GoBike System Data Explorartion
## by Mazi Essoloani Aleza


## Dataset

This dataset will require some data wrangling in order to make it tidy for analysis. There are multiple cities covered by the linked system, and multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full yearâ€™s coverage is desired.
More information on this dataset can be found on https://github.com/BetaNYC/Bike-Share-Data-Best-Practices/wiki/Bike-Share-Data-Systems 


## Summary of Findings

I observed that the average ride duration is higher on weekends (saturday and sanday), sunday has the highest ride duration, during the other week day the ride duration is very small compared to the weekends. The correlation between distance and duration is very low, some start and end distance are the same (that can mean that there is no movement or the bike rider return to the start location after riding and end the ride at the start location)


## Key Insights for Presentation
- The other gender has the longer average ride duration
- The Customers have the longer average ride duration
- The female customers have the longer ride duration
- Sutardays and sundays have the longer ride duration
